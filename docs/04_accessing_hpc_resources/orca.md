## What is Orca?

Most NHM servers are inaccessible from outside the NHM network unless you are connected to the VPN on an NHM laptop. Orca provides a solution to this issue.

Orca acts as a bastion server, a secure gateway that allows you to reach internal NHM servers from outside the network.

To connect to Orca, use an SSH client such as PuTTY or Terminal. Once connected, you can access servers within the NHM network, such as:

- franklin
- sanger
- hpc-head-002

Access to Orca must be granted by Technology Solutions. Email [TS-ServiceDesk@nhm.ac.uk](mailto:TS-ServiceDesk@nhm.ac.uk) to request access.

{: .note }
> If you're using an NHM computer, you don't need to use Orca - use VPN instead.

## Usage guide

### Download Authenticator app

Orca employs multi-factor authentication (MFA), which can be facilitated using an authenticator app such as:

- Google Authenticator
- Microsoft Authenticator

You can download the app on your smartphone from the App Store (iOS) or the Play Store (Android). Both work phones and personal phones are suitable for this purpose.

### Connect to Orca for the first time

This section provides instructions on how to connect to Orca for the first time and set up your multi-factor authentication (MFA). This will be demonstrated using PuTTY (available on Windows) and the standard Terminal (available on Linux, macOS, and Windows). You can also use other SSH software if you prefer.

If using PuTTY, under **Host Name** type `<username>@orca.nhm.ac.uk`. Leave everything else as default and click **Open**. For example:

![PuTTY-orca](hpc_images/PuTTY-orca.png)

Or if using Terminal, type `ssh <username>@orca.nhm.ac.uk`. For example:

```
$ ssh robtest1234@orca.nhm.ac.uk
```

Type in your password at the prompt (you won't see it while typing, but it still works):

```
$ ssh robtest1234@orca.nhm.ac.uk

Please download the google authenticator to use with this verification code
Warning: pasting the following URL into your browser exposes the OTP secret to Google:
  https://www.google.com/chart?chs=200x200&chld=M|0&cht=qr&chl=otpauth://totp/robtest1
...
```

You will see a QR code. Scan it with the Authenticator app. At the `Enter code from app` prompt, enter the 6-digit code from the app. You should then see a prompt that says `<username>@ssh-bastion-6:~$`. This means that you're successfully connected to Orca.

{: .note }
> If the QR code does not display correctly or is too big for your screen, you will not be able to scan it. Don't worry - you will also see a **secret key**. You can type this into the Authenticator app instead of scanning the QR code. 

Now let's test that it's working. Close your PuTTY or Terminal window and re-open it, then connect again to `orca.nhm.ac.uk`. This time you will be prompted for your password and verification code from the Authenticator app. Enter these details and you will be successfully connected to Orca. For example:

```
$ ssh robtest1234@orca.nhm.ac.uk

```

### Connect to other servers via Orca

From Orca you can connect to other servers such as Franklin, Sanger, or hpc-jobs-001.

For example, to connect to hpc-jobs-001 you would type `ssh hpc-jobs-001` and enter your password. For example:

```
robtest1234@ssh-bastion-6:~$ ssh hpc-jobs-001
robtest1234@hpc-jobs-001's password:
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-200-generic x86_64)
...
robtest1234@hpc-jobs-001:~$
```

In the above example, I connected to Orca and then to hpc-jobs-001 in two separate steps. However, it's possible to do it in a single command, like this: 
```
ssh -J <username>@orca.nhm.ac.uk <username>@<destination_server>
```

For example, this is how I would connect from my computer to hpc-jobs-001 via Orca in a single command:

```
PS C:\Users\robef3> ssh -J robtest1234@orca.nhm.ac.uk robtest1234@hpc-jobs-001

### SCPs and SFTPs 

There are two common ways to transfer files to a remote server: SCP (Secure Copy) is a simple command-line tool for copying files. SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is more fully featured and is used by graphical tools like FileZilla and Cyberduck. WinSCP supports both protocols and is covered in the SCP section below, where it is configured to use SCP.

#### Using SCP

You can use SCP to transfer files through orca to your destination server. This can be done with a graphical program like [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/introduction), or via the [Terminal](#terminal).

##### WinSCP

You can use WinSCP on a Windows machine to transfer files to and from a remote server. To do this, open WinSCP and fill in the details like below:

- File Protocol: **SCP**
- Host name: The server you want to connect to
- User name: Your username
- Password: Your password

Click **Advanced**.

![winscp-login](hpc_images/winscp-login.png)

Click **Tunnel**. Then tick the box **Connect through SSH tunnel**. Fill in the details like below:

- Host name: **orca.nhm.ac.uk**
- User name: Your username
- Password: Your password

Click **OK**, then **Login**.
 
![winscp-tunnel](hpc_images/winscp-tunnel.png)

Click **Continue** at the authentication banner.
 
![winscp-auth-banner](hpc_images/winscp-auth-banner.png)

Enter your verification code from the Authenticator app then click **OK**.

![winscp-mfa-code](hpc_images/winscp-mfa-code.png) 

You may need to enter your password a second time, and may see a few prompts that you need to click through. You should then be connected to the remote server, where you can upload and download files.
 
![winscp-files](hpc_images/winscp-files.png) 

##### Terminal

To use SCP to copy a file from your local computer through Orca to your destination server, use the following syntax:
```
scp -o 'ProxyJump <username>@orca.nhm.ac.uk' myfile <username>@<destination_server>:~/mydir
```

This example will upload a file called `myfile` from the local computer to the `/home/robtest1234/mydir` directory on hpc-jobs-001:

```
$ scp -o 'ProxyJump robtest1234@orca.nhm.ac.uk' myfile robtest1234@hpc-jobs-001:~/mydir

-----------------------------------------------------------
robtest1234@hpc-jobs-001's password:
myfile                        100%    0     0.0KB/s   00:00
(sphinx) [robef3@HYB-rF9MA5WUwGJ ~]$
```

To download a file from the destination server to the directory you are currently in on your local computer, you use this command:
```
scp -o 'ProxyJump <username>@orca.nhm.ac.uk' <username>@<server>:~/mydir/myfile .
```

{: .note }
> The download command must be run from a terminal on your **local computer**, not from a terminal where you are already connected to the server. Open a new terminal window on your local machine before running it.
 
#### Using SFTP

##### FileZilla or Cyberduck

If you need to use a graphical SFTP client like FileZilla or Cyberduck, you will need to establish an SSH tunnel via the terminal. This is because FileZilla and Cyberduck do not have built-in tunnelling support (unlike WinSCP). 

On your computer, open the terminal and create the SSH tunnel. The `8888` in this command can be any unused port on your computer between 1024 and 32768:
```
ssh -L 8888:<destination_server>:22 <username>@orca.nhm.ac.uk cat -
```

Enter your password and Authenticator code. For example:
```
$ ssh -L 8888:hpc-jobs-001:22 robtest123@orca.nhm.ac.uk cat -

-----------------------------------------------------------
(robtest123@orca.nhm.ac.uk) Password:
(robtest123@orca.nhm.ac.uk) Verification code:

```

The terminal will appear to hang, but this is expected - it means the SSH tunnel has been established. 

{: .warning }
> Don't cancel out of it until you have finished your file transfer, otherwise the tunnel will be closed!

Open FileZilla and enter the following credentials (if using Cyberduck, the options are basically the same):

- Host: **sftp://127.0.0.1**
- Username: Your username 
- Password: Your password 
- Port: The same port used to establish the tunnel, i.e. 8888

Click **Quickconnect.**

If you see a prompt regarding Unknown Host Key, click **OK**.

You should then be connected to the remote server, where you can upload and download files.
 
![filezilla](hpc_images/filezilla.png) 

Once you are done, go back to your terminal and close the SSH tunnel by pressing CTRL+C.
